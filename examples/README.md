The files in this directory contain the example code from class.  Note that during each class we make several changes to these files to illustrate multiple concepts, so not all the features / concepts we cover in class are demonstrated by the code here.  Also note that the code here does not reflect how you should style your code base.  The files here are just for reference - if you have a conceptual or design question please email me or post on Piazza.
